<h1 align="center">[Portfolio V1](https://maxcroy.com)</h1>
Welcome to my first portfolio! My goal with this project was to build an effective portfolio that was eye-catching - hopefully you feel like I was successful! 

# Tech Stack
- Gatsby
- React
- Markdown (for job and portfolio descriptions)

# Process
- I started with design, making a quick mockup in Figma. I focused solely on the Desktop design (more on this later), but once I found a design I was happy with, I got started.
- Having some brief experience with Gatsby, I figured it would help me speed up the total development time of the project. Setting up the repo and template took about 5 minutes, and once it was done, I was off to the races!

# Learnings
- I wish I had started with Mobile design in my mockup process first, as translating the desktop design to mobile took some serious work and went against convention. Moving forward, I'm going to make this a habit.
